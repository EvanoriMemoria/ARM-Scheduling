\section{Optimization Targets}
\subsection{Power vs. Performance}
The two main targets to be considered when determining a scheduling policy are power and performance. There can be two extremes regarding these targets: 100\% performance and 0\% power efficiency, or 0\% performance and 100\% power efficiency. Ideally, the scheduling policy should lie somewhere in the middle between these two extremes.\cite{AAP2013}
