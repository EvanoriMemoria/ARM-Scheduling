\section{WASH}
While the schedulers we have examined already certainly have large improvements over existing schedulers, we could certainly do better.
On asymmetric processors a lot of assumptions that are made about how we schedule multithreaded programs are broken.
In particular we can look at the threads of a single program and find threads which have a higher priority to finish quickly and actually do something about them finishing more quickly.
The WASH scheduler keeps track of how many other threads are waiting on each thread to release its locks.

\subsection{Implementation}
WASH is implemented as an extension to the JikesVM Java Virtual Machine.
This allows the scheduler much further insight into the operation of each thread than a kernal space scheduler has.
The drawback of this implementation is that WASH can only set the core priorities of each virtual machine thread, it cannot influence the threads of other processes on the system.
If the application that WASH is scheduling is the primary load on the system this is not an issue, but it shows the difficulty in generalizing this solution.
